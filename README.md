<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a senior Laravel developer and system architect. I am highly motivated, dedicated to delivering high-quality code, and continuously improving on every project. 
I pride myself on efficiency, have worked with numerous tools, and have completed a variety of projects over the past 7 years.<br><br>

In my free time I've built and maintain repo of my own like:

- <strong>Laravel / CodeIgniter / PHP </strong><br>
- <strong>Laravel & VueJS</strong><br>
- <strong>Laravel & ReactJS</strong><br>
- <strong>Laravel & Flutter</strong><br></p><br>
